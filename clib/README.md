# clvm_rs

The `clvm_rs` package provides implementations of clvm for mobile platforms, specifically Android and iOS.

This project is in its early stages. Contributions and pull requests are welcome.

## Prerequisites

Before building for Android or iOS, ensure you have the necessary tools installed:

- **cbindgen**: This tool is used to generate C header files from Rust.

  ```bash
  cargo install cbindgen
